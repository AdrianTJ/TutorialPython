# TutorialPython
Credit goes to user sentdex on youtube for the tutorial videos from which these functions come from. I'm mostly just transcribing the scripts from those videos to .py and adding some personal comments where I feel is necessary.
Mostly just a list of useful scripts to go back to to check the syntax of some basic python functionality.
